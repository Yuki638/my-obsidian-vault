## Pull/Merge Request Details Pull/Merge Request Details

Here’s how we validate contributor pull/merge requests (“**PR/MRs**”) for Hacktoberfest

**out-of-bounds** Your PR/MRs must be within the bounds of Hacktoberfest.

Your PR/MRs must be created between <font color ="red">October 1</font> and <font color ="red">October 31</font> (in any time zone, UTC-12 thru UTC+14).

Your PR/MRs must be made to a public, un-archived [[repository]].

Pull/merge requests created before October 1 but merged or marked as ready for review after **do not count**.

**excluded** Repositories that go against Hacktoberfest’s values will be excluded from qualification and PR/MRs made to those repositories won’t count.

* **<font color ="red">spam-</font>** Your PR/MRs must not be spammy.

* <font color ="red">participating-</font> Your PR/MRs must be in a [[repository]] tagged with the “hacktoberfest” topic, or have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label.

* <font color ="red">invalid-</font> Your PR/MRs must not be labeled as “invalid”.

* <font color ="red">accepted-</font> Your PR/MRs must be merged, have the “hacktoberfest-accepted” label, or have an overall approving review.

Once your PR/MRs pass all the checks above, it will be accepted for Hacktoberfest after the seven day review period.
