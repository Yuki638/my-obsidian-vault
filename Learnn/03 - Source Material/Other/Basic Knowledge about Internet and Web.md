## IP Address

Lets Imagine Internet as a big city, and every house in that city needs specific address so different can find its way to that address. In the world of technology and computer, that "address" is called an IP Address.

#### What is an IP address?

An IP address is like the address of a house, but for your device (like your computer, phone, or tablet) when it connects to the internet. It's a series of numbers, such as 192.168.1.1 or 8.8.8.8. Every device that’s connected to the internet has its own IP address, so data knows where to go.

#### Types of IP Addresses

There are two types of IP addresses:

    1. IPv4: The most common one, like 192.168.1.1, which is four numbers separated by dots.
    2. IPv6: The newer version, which looks longer and more complex, like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, because the internet needs more addresses than IPv4 can provide.

### How do websites use IP addresses?

Websites also have their own IP addresses. When you type a website's name like "google.com" into the [[browser]], something magical happens. Behind the scenes, your computer asks a special phonebook-like service called **[[DNS]] (Domain Name System)** to look up the IP address of that website. It's like asking for the address of a store by its name.

For example:

- You type "google.com."
- The [[DNS]] finds out that Google’s IP address is something like `142.250.190.46`.
- Your computer then uses that IP address to send a message to Google’s servers, asking for the webpage.
- Google’s servers receive your request, then send the webpage back to you.

In this way, even though you use easy names like "google.com," the computers behind the scenes talk to each other using IP addresses to send and receive information.

### Why does it matter?

Without IP addresses, your computer wouldn't know how to find the websites you want to visit or how to communicate with other devices! It's like sending a letter without knowing the address of where it should go.
