first lets discuss the similarity they share
- they both store numbers and texts

we may use [[jupyter notebook]] snippets for giving a clear understanding.
# flexibility

- <font color ="red">List</font>- they can store both numbers and texts together like the same list can store number and text like 
```python
list1 = [12 , 12.0 , "twelve"]
```
- <font color ="red">Array</font>- they are meant to store only one type of item like either all numbers or all strings. but it doesn't mean they cant store different type of data types ! it's not the best tool to store different data types.

 the above snippet shows how to create an array. in the above snippet we created a 2d array
# mathematical computing

- <font color ="red">List</font>- they are not really good for mathematical computing. they are basically just use to store all datatypes together.
- <font color="red">Array</font>- they are really good for mathematical computation. you need to import numpy to make an array and use them. they are often used with pandas to perform mathematical computation on the dataset by selecting a specific column or series and do mathematical computation like finding mean , median ,sum.

the above snippet displays the mean , median and sum functions using numpy
