Today I learn something really valuable from the guy name [[khalid]] from [[discord]] that you have 24 hours a day and you can do a lot of things for example he spends some part of the day learning Linux with me then he is working on some project of [[automation]] for a girl who asked to make [[automation]] on some datasets that was available in [[eBay]] [[khalid]] said she wrote those huge datasets written CSV on her own manually  , then he also spends his 2 hours training the model i said him to help with . I really wanna for real know stuffs like him . Like he knows so many things i want to know those things as well that he knows.

I'm sure I'll continue to learn if I learn how to be organized XD
have a good night but before that i'll make sure I read "The winter king" by [[Bernard Cornwell]].
